#### Bayesian Linear Regression 

Task 1 - Fit a Gaussian RBF model to training data

Task 2 - Identified the best posterior mean model for a given λ value.

Task 3 - Implemented error bars for predictions and created an algorithm that determines whwether a prediction is worth being made given an associated penalty and reward for incorrect and correct estimates.

First hands-on exposure to Bayesian approaches in machine learning. Furthered my mathematical script writing in this project using Python.
